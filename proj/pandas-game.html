                The idea for this game came from a simple but fun story: I wanted to review the Pandas library and how to manipulate and analyze tables, but I wanted it to be more engaging than just a typical quiz. At the same time, I wanted to make the review interactive without making a basic flashcard set. Plus, I was eager to learn Streamlit since I’d never used it before. So, what better way to kill two birds with one stone than by creating a Pandas review game using Streamlit?

                <p class="about-proj-text">
                I found a cool part of this project to be figuring out how to build navigation—like making “home” and “back” buttons work smoothly by utilizing Streamlit’s session state to keep track of user progress. It was interesting to see how those features could really improve the flow and user experience.

                <p class="about-proj-text">
                Overall, this project really helped me get comfortable with Streamlit by building and launching an interactive web app from scratch. I learned how to smoothly integrate data and tables into the interface, which was super useful. It also pushed me to think about creating a tool that’s not just functional but actually engaging and helpful for others who want to learn. On top of that, it gave me a chance to practice and show off my Pandas skills on both small and large data in a way that feels practical and hands-on.
