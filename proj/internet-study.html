            <h2>Analysis of Internet Word Usage</h2>

                    As a history major, I’ve always been interested in how technology has shaped American life. For my future capstone thesis, I’m planning to focus on the Internet and its origins, especially the shift from ARPANET to what we think of as the modern internet. But before jumping into that, I wanted to start with something smaller: figuring out when people actually began talking about the internet in everyday language. This mini case study looks at how internet-related words changed over time and what that might say about cultural shifts.
                </p>
                <p class="about-proj-text">
                    To explore this, I used data from Google’s Ngram Viewer, which tracks how often specific words appear in books over time. I chose terms like “internet,” “email,” “world wide web,” and others that reflect different aspects of being online. I downloaded the data as CSV files and used Python, pandas, and matplotlib to visualize the trends from 1960 to 2019. While this isn’t a perfect way to measure public awareness, it gives a rough idea of when different internet-related ideas started becoming more culturally relevant.

                <p class="about-proj-text">
                First, I began with a basic raw-count line plot. This plot uses raw data from Ngram and gives a more direct look at how often these words appeared in books. “Online” took off the fastest and reached the highest point by far. “Website” and “email” also rose steadily. On the other hand, terms like “cyberspace” and “modem” had shorter moments of popularity. They hit their peak in the early 2000s and dropped off soon after, which shows how fast some terms can become outdated as technology moves forward.

                <img src="/images/proj-img/internet case study/int4.png" alt="Olivia's photo" class="about-proj-photo" />
                <p class="about-proj-text">
                I then wanted to put everything on the same scale to compare their popularity more directly with a normalized plot. “World wide web” and “http” had quick rises but dropped off later, while “internet” and “email” stayed high into the 2010s. “Social media” and “wi-fi” appear later in the timeline but grow quickly, showing how our focus shifted to connectivity and communication. Meanwhile, older terms like “modem,” “dot-com,” and “cyberspace” fell off, suggesting a clear change in the way we talk about the internet.

                <p class="about-proj-text">
                Looking at term frequency by decade helps show how quickly things changed. In the 1990s, there was a burst of new terms like “modem,” “cyberspace,” and “http,” which matched the early push to get online. By the 2000s and 2010s, the focus shifted more toward content and communication, with terms like “email,” “website,” and “social media” standing out. “Wi-fi” didn’t show up much early on but gained momentum later, which matches the broader shift to wireless technology.
                </p>

                <p class="about-proj-text">
                Lastly, wanted to focus on how specific terms were used between 1995 and 2005. “World wide web” was strong early on but started to fade after 2000. At the same time, terms like “email” and “http” kept rising and eventually passed it. “Internet” showed steady growth across the whole period, while “dot-com” had a sharp spike right around 2000, which probably lines up with the dot-com boom. These shifts show how the language around the internet moved from new concepts to more practical and commonly used terms.

                Overall, studying these word trends gave me a clearer sense of how the internet moved from being a new concept to something people use and talk about every day. The early excitement around words like “modem” and “cyberspace” faded over time, while terms like “email,” “social media,” and “wi-fi” became more common and reflective of how the internet is actually used. One of the biggest takeaways was the massive rise in the use of the word “online,” which quickly became the go-to way of referring to digital spaces in general. This was a small project, but it helped me see how language shifts alongside technology, and gave me a useful starting point for future research into ARPANET and the early internet.
