                    I'm currently volunteering with Axcel Portals, a company that supports clients as they grow their businesses internationally. They offer services like incorporation, compliance, and consulting, all aimed at making global expansion feel more manageable. I'm helping strengthen their digital presence and share what they do with a wider audience in a clear and engaging way.

                    I helped design and digitize Axcel Portals’ logo, then built out the website to match that same clean and professional look. The goal was to create a site that felt simple and welcoming while clearly laying out what the company offers. I worked on everything from the structure and layout to the written content, making sure the site was easy to navigate and aligned with the company’s tone and values. Along the way, I got hands-on experience with web design, branding, and content strategy.

                    Outside of the website, I also manage Axcel Portals’ social media accounts on Instagram and X. It’s been really fun getting to go out and help film content, then bring it to life using tools like Lightroom and After Effects (proud to have taken and edited the photo above!). I focus on creating posts that feel authentic and engaging, while keeping the company’s voice consistent across platforms. This role has been a great way to explore digital marketing, creative planning, and hands-on content creation.
