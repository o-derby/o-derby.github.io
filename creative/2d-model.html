                I had a ton of fun making this 2D model from scratch, even though it took a lot of time and effor! Over 25 hours in total! I started by designing the character and drawing her in Art Studio Pro, which is one of my favorite apps. I had to separate every part of the body, including all the little shading details, to prep for rigging. Then I brought it all into Live2D, which had a bit of a learning curve but ended up being a super cool program. The eye-bounce physics were fun to do! I rigged the model so she could move and respond to face tracking, and now I can use her in VTube Studio and other apps. It was a long process but totally worth it!
